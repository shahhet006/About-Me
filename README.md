About Me
👋 Hi, I'm Het Shah — a data analyst and business intelligence enthusiast passionate about uncovering insights that drive smart, strategic decisions. I’m a recent graduate in Business Analytics at The University of Texas at Dallas and actively seeking a full-time opportunity to apply my skills in a real-world, impact-driven environment.

📊 With a strong foundation in statistics, machine learning, and programming (Python, SQL), I specialize in transforming raw data into actionable insights. My academic and professional journey has equipped me with hands-on experience in tools like TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and Tableau, as well as a deep understanding of database management and data mining techniques.

🚀 At Infosys, I tackled real-world business problems by leveraging data to drive solutions, identifying factors behind customer churn, optimizing service delivery, and building dashboards for better decision-making. I’m naturally curious, love solving complex problems, and thrive when working with diverse data sets to uncover patterns and trends that others might miss.

🤝 I'm excited about collaborating on challenging analytics projects and learning from industry leaders. I aim to contribute to a team where innovation meets impact—where data is not just crunched, but transformed into meaningful stories and strategies.

📫 Let’s connect! Reach me at het.shah@utdallas.edu or on LinkedIn. I’d love to explore how I can bring value to your team and help drive business intelligence initiatives forward.
